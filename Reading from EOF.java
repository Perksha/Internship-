The challenge here is to read  lines of input until you reach EOF, then number and print all  lines of content.

Hint: Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful for this problem.

Input Format

Read some unknown  lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner s= new Scanner(System.in);
        int i=1;
        while(s.hasNext()){
          String line= s.nextLine();
          System.out.println(i+" "+ line);
          i++;  
        }
    }
}
